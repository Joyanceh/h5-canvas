","The lack of defences meant that when humans arrived in the range 700 years ago, it was <span>hunted</span> to intensely small numbers followed by further decreases when <span>pest control predators</span> for other species were introduced in the late 1800s.","It hunts using its spiky tongue to find and digest worms, but is itself on the receiving end of <span>hunting, by humans for food</span>. It has also suffered from habitat loss in ranges now densely populated by locals. ","Climate change and pollution from events such as <span>oil spills</span> has had an effect, but depletion of eggs via over-collection and intense fishing in the area has also impacted their status.","This aspect puts the fly under threat as climate change can affect the already <span>poorly managed brooks</span> very easily, and expanding tourism increases the threat.","Hunting and deforestation impact to varying degrees depending on the range, with <span>forest fires, developments and logging</span> all contributing to lost habitat.","This fish coasts into shallow water which increases the risk of being caught by fisherman, but its <span>habitat has also declined</span> rapidly over the past 25 years.","Consistent hunting over the past 30 years has caused significant decline while predation from wolves in the range adds to the problems faced.","Located mainly in the Maluku Islands, the lowland areas of forest where the Butterfly resides has been greatly reduced by logging.
